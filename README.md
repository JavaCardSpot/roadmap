## JavaCardSpot - where JavaCard smartcards enjoy more openness 

We aim to increase the open-source community around JavaCard platform and cryptographic smartcards in general. The banks, governments and security professionals depend on the high-security chips with JavaCard platform for more than 20 years - why not make it available for wider community as well? 

### The plan 

The [analysis of JavaCard open-source ecosystem](https://medium.com/enigma-shards/analysis-of-javacard-open-source-ecosystem-9be0bfd66398) from June 2017 maps the situation, here we focus on raising awareness of the potential, supporting developers and helping users to obtain smartcard and load it quickly with a suite of useful applications. Our goal is clearly a long-term project, but we are working on it already for more than 10 years. And the JavaCards started to be available for less than $5 recently - finally opening the playground.  

**Help us to:**
- Make people aware of the potential
- Make easy for newbies to start fiddling with cards and applets
  - ready-to-use applications (JavaCardSpot prepares selection of prepared applets)
  - [curated list Javacard applets](https://github.com/EnigmaBridge/javacard-curated-list)
- Support developers
  - FOSS developer tools (compile, convert, upload, debug, profile) 
  - development tutorials
  - security guidelines 
- Support innovative applications and research projects without NDAs   
  - low-level API like [ECPoint operations ](https://github.com/OpenCryptoProject/JCMathLib)
